  <h1 id="ResearchTopic"> Research Overview: </h1>
  <p id="ResearchInterest">Thesis is comprised of two parts:</p>
  <ul id="topics">
    <li>The difference in the scattering cross sections for two
  helicity states of a longitudinally polarized proton target for hard
  exclusive photon productions will be extracted for the first
  time. The cross section difference will be extracted in 4
  dimensional kinematic bins covering a wide kinematic range.
  Combined with other DVCS measurements, the generalized parton
  distributions (GPDs), which will encode information on the
  distribution of partons in the transverse plane and in the
  longitudinal direction. will be accessed.</li> 
    <li>A Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector for the upgraded CLAS
  spectrometer (CLAS12) will be developed. The CLAS12 RICH
  detector is designed to provide the CLAS12 detector with the
  capability to identify kaons in the 3-5 GeV momentum range with a
  rejection power with respect to pions and protons about 1:500.</li>
  </ul>
